# Comprehensive Algorithms and Data Structures.

This repository houses my solutions and detailed explanations to popular algorithms and data structures problems. The solutions are provided in `JavaScript` / `TypeScript`, `Python`, `C` and `Java` which are languages that I am more comfortable with. The repo is intended to be my online reference or notes as I learn these topics and I hope you found this information valuable. Feel free to fork/clone or let me know how I can improve it. 

*Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and directories containing solutions in the various languages*
